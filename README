The Swarm is a third party AfterDark screen saver module by
Leo Breebaart. Should also work with DarkSide of the Mac. I
found it on AppleFritter with source code. This was the first
easy source code I could find.

There is a .net C# version floating around but the download 
link required a login and I was too lazy to create an account.

Swarm is available as a screen saver on SGI IRIX. I have an
Indy sitting on my desk right now so I can watch it a bit.

I would try out the AfterDark module, but maybe later. I have
a fitting Mac (WorkGroup Server 6100/66) to try, but don't feel
like setting it up right now.

I want to make a version that displays on the 128x64 OLED
display sold by Adafruit.com. I was thinking of using Arduino
or maybe more interestingly, on the LPC1343 ARM processor. I
originally thought a nice project would be porting the SSD1306
Arduino library from Adafruit to the LPC1343 within the LPC1300
library published by MicroBuilder (Kevin Townsend), but then
Kevin created SSD1306 support.
