The FAT version of The Swarm is created using a method directly based onthe one described by Robert Geisler (geisler@fserv1.mpib-tuebingen.mpg.de)in his "Fat Module" example code. This README file is also largely basedon his README.BUILDING THE MODULE1. Install ToolServer as described in the file "How to add Tools", which   is in CodeWarrior7:Metrowerks C/C++.2. Make "The Swarm.µ".3. Copy the resulting module to this Fat Swarm folder, and rename it to    "The Swarm FAT". The exact name is important!4. Make "The Swarm PEF.µ"5. Start ToolServer from the Tools menu of Metrowerks C/C++.   Switch to ToolServer, and execute the script "The Swarm FAT TS Script".   6. "The Swarm FAT" now contains a safe fat code resource.For more information on how to make Fat After Dark modules, see Robert's "Fat Module"(see The Swarm README for info on where to find it).
